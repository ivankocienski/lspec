* before, around, after callbacks
  > around done, before and after can be derived from this
? 'let' and 'let!' declarations
  > just use (let) forms!
* empty 'it' and 'context' blocks becoming pending
* pending keyword in 'it' block stops test
- configuration block (needed yet?)

* run specific test
* better formatters
* catch all errors on a run and report them in one final list

- dot formatter
- switching formatters
- listing formatters

- exportarise
- documentation / examples

ideas in no real order:

- colour output
- 'clean' mode (start a new lisp, load app/tests and run in fresh environment)
- tags- tests can be grouped, ie :ui :db :network etc.
- dependencies- tests will run in order of precedence
- sanity checks
  - around-callbacks check if 'yield' being called once
